# Crown List App

Our app can help users to record the tasks need to be done, make priority, track completeness, get notifications and check tasks on calendar. 

The app contains five features, which are adding/deleting an item, setting a reminder for an item, editing an existing item, tracking completed/uncompleted item and calendar support.
